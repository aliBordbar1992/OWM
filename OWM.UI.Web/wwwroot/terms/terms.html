            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <h3>LIABILITY WAIVER</h3>
            <p>
                I understand that the “One World Marathon” (the “Event”) is an extreme
                sporting event. Participation is voluntary and entirely at my own risk
                and that participating in the Event is potentially hazardous, and that I
                should not enter and participate unless I am medically able and properly
                trained, and agree to the terms and conditions below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. In consideration of the acceptance of this entry, I assume full and
                    complete responsibility for any injury or accident which may occur
                    while I am traveling to or from the Event, during the Event (i.e., out
                    on the course), or while I am on the premises of the Event.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. I also am aware of and assume all risks associated with
                    participating in the Event, including, but not limited to, falls,
                    contact with other participants, effect of weather, traffic, and
                    conditions of the road.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. Barring its legal liability, One World Strong Foundation Inc. (the
                    “Event Organizer”) shall not be responsible or financially liable for
                    any accidents and/or illness suffered by the participant, for loss of
                    property, any damages to equipment or cars parked on site, for any
                    other damages allegedly suffered by the participant or caused by the
                    general public.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. Should a participant’s actions out on the course cause an incident
                    resulting in damage to other road users property, the participant will
                    take responsibility and will assume financial liability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    5. I understand that this liability waiver includes any claims,
                    whether caused by negligence or the action or inaction of the Event
                    Organizer, other participants, supporters, the general public or
                    myself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    6. Each participant must follow instructions as given from all event
                    officials, including instructions at race briefings, from any of the
                    race staff, volunteers, medical personnel, security officers and other
                    officials throughout the duration of the Event.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a. We do not recommend the use of personal music devices (such as
                            MP3 players) on the course as you need to be aware of and be able
                            to hear other runners, other public road users (such as cars and
                            bicycles), and to hear the instructions of the race directors and
                            race marshal. If you do wear headphones, then it is at your own
                            risk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            b. Each participant is responsible for their awareness,
                            recognition and understanding of Event signage, symbols and colors
                            relating to participant maps, facilities and direction.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    7. I grant my permission to the Event Organizer, the owners of the
                    applicable venues, their sponsors, their promoters, and their
                    representatives to use or authorize others to use photographs, motion
                    pictures, recordings, or any other record of my participation in the
                    Event for any legitimate purpose without remuneration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    8. I, for myself and my heirs and executors, hereby waive, release and
                    forever discharge the Event Organizer, the owners of the applicable
                    venues, their sponsors, their promoters, representatives, successors
                    and assigns, and all other persons associated with the Event (e.g.,
                    race directors and race marshals), for all my liabilities, claims,
                    actions, or damages that I may have against them arising out of or in
                    any way connected with my participation in this Event.
