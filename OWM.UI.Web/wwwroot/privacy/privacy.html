            <p>
                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has
                provided
                us with Personal Information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or
                guardian
                and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us so that
                we
                will be able to do necessary actions. Under applicable European data protection laws, including the
                GDPR,
                (together the “European Data Protection Laws”) children between the age of 13 to 16 may provide valid
                consent to process their Personal Information. Where consent is required under such Data Protection
                Laws,
                you have the obligation to provide to us evidence of such consent or, as required under the Data
                Protection
                Laws, the authorization of the holder of parental responsibility for the child. We may refuse to
                process, or
                continue to process, the child’s Personal Information until we receive this evidence of consent or
                authorization.
            </p>
            <h3>1.11 ADDITIONAL RIGHTS FOR RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION</h3>

                If you reside or are located in the European Economic Area and the UK you may have additional rights
                under
                applicable European Data Protection Laws, One World is the data controller. You have the right to ensure
                your Personal Information is accurate. You have the right to request that we delete your Personal

                European Data Protection Laws. You also have the right to request that we restrict the processing of
                your
                Personal Information. This may compromise our ability to provide you with our services. You also have
                the
                right to transfer your Personal Information to another service provider subject to applicable European
                Data
                Protection Laws. We will, following your written request to us, provide you with your relevant Personal
                Information in a machine-readable format to transfer to another service provider. We will aim to respond
                to
                your request within one calendar month of receipt of the request. Where we were unable to do so within
                the
                calendar month, we will notify you of our need to extend this timeline by up to a further two months.
                There
                are certain exemptions and restrictions of these rights under European Data Protection Laws that enable
                Personal Information to be retained, processed or withheld from access and we will inform you of these
                if
                applicable.

                obligations to further retain such information. To determine the appropriate retention period for your
                Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, sensitivity of Personal Information, the potential
                risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we

                compared to those in your country of residence) and other such jurisdictions which have a less stringent
                standard of data privacy laws compared to those in your country of residence. We protect and keep secure
                your Personal Information as required by European Data Protection Laws. [We use standard contractual
